# Content Generation

The **Content Generation** feature helps you make long articles in nBlick. You pick a category, choose one or more prompts, and set the language and length. You can also add extra details. Then nBlick writes the article for you.

> 💡 The article is made from the prompts and settings you choose. Use the category and extra information to control what the article is about and how it sounds.

## Category

You must pick a **category** first. A category is like a topic. It filters the list so you only see prompts that fit that topic.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Category** | Pick one category from the list. You have to do this step. It decides which prompts you see next. |

After you pick a category, the list of prompts updates. You will only see prompts for that category.

## Prompts

**Prompts** are the main ideas for your article. Each prompt is one idea or question that will show up in the article.

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Prompts** | Pick one or more prompts. The list is empty until you choose a category. You will see *"Please select a category first to view available prompts."* until then. |

You can pick more than one prompt. The article will then cover all of those ideas.

## Content Settings

These settings tell nBlick how to write the article: where it will be used, what language, how long, and any extra instructions.

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Platforms** *(optional)* | Where the article will be used (for example **Google**). Use this when you want the article to match a certain place. |
| **Language of the final article** | The language of the article (for example **English**). |
| **Word Range** | How long the article should be (for example **1500–2000** words). Using the recommended range keeps the article at a good length. |
| **Additional Information** *(optional)* | A box where you can type anything extra. You can add rules, links, sources, or other details that should affect the article. |

Change these settings each time you generate an article so they match what you want.

## Article Title

You can set the title of the article in two ways:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Recommended title** | nBlick can suggest a title based on popular pages for your prompts. Use this when you want a title that works well for search. |
| **Custom title** | Type your own title in the **Title** box (for example *"Write a title…"*) when you want to choose the headline yourself. |

Pick the option that works best for you.
