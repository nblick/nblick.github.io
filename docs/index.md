# Welcome to nBlick Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for **nBlick** — the AI Brand Visibility platform built for the LLM era.

As search shifts from Google to AI assistants like **ChatGPT, Gemini, Perplexity, Claude, Mistral, DeepSeek, and others**, brands face a new question:

> *How is my brand being represented inside AI-generated answers?*

nBlick gives you that visibility.

## Why nBlick Exists

Large Language Models are becoming the new discovery layer of the internet.  
Customers now ask AI:

- "What's the best tool for X?"
- "Which company should I choose for Y?"
- "Compare Brand A vs Brand B"
- "What are alternatives to Z?"

If your brand isn't mentioned — or is mentioned incorrectly — you're invisible.

nBlick helps brands and companies:

- Track **how often they are mentioned across every major LLM**
- Understand **how they are described**
- Monitor **competitor presence**
- Detect **positioning gaps**
- Measure **AI visibility over time**

We do for AI answers what SEO tools did for search engines.

## What nBlick Tracks

nBlick continuously monitors and analyzes responses across:

- ChatGPT  
- Gemini  
- Perplexity  
- Claude  
- Mistral  
- DeepSeek  
- And emerging LLM platforms  

Every day, we generate queries, collect responses, and transform them into structured, actionable insights.

- **Brand Mention Rate** — How often your brand appears
- **Share of AI Voice** — Visibility vs competitors
