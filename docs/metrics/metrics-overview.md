# Metrics Overview

Get a clear view of the key metrics that guide your AI visibility strategy. nBlick helps brands understand how they are seen and mentioned by LLMs across the AI landscape.

## The Three Pillars of AI Visibility

nBlick tracks three fundamental dimensions of your brand's presence inside AI responses:

### Brand Sentiment Analysis

**The overall perception of your brand as reflected by AI.**

The sentiment score reflects the overall brand perception. A score of 0% indicates a generally negative perception, while a score of 100% represents an excellent perception.

### Share of Voice

**The ratios of mentions of your brand and its products on common queries to the LLM.**

Share of Voice measures how often your brand is mentioned relative to competitors across AI-generated responses. Toggle between product-specific and aggregated brand views to understand your presence at different levels.

### Brand Keywords

**The top 10 most frequently associated words, phrases, and topics linked to your brand.**

These keywords represent recurring themes that LLMs commonly connect with your brand, focusing on both positive and negative associations that reflect the brand's values and customer perception.

## How nBlick Metrics Are Generated

!!! info "Continuous Data Collection"
    nBlick runs queries across all tracked LLMs daily. Since AI responses can vary, we aggregate and analyze data over time to generate meaningful metrics.

Metrics come from multiple sources:

- **AI Responses** — Individual answers to brand-related prompts
- **Referenced Sources** — Articles, websites, and documents that AI cites
- **Trend Analysis** — Patterns observed across configurable time periods

## Interpreting Your Metrics

| Metric                        | Positive Signal                              | Warning Sign                                  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Brand Sentiment Analysis**  | High sentiment score (closer to 100%)        | Declining score or persistently low percentage |
| **Share of Voice**            | Steady or growing mention ratios             | Decreasing visibility or competitor growth     |
| **Brand Keywords**            | Positive, relevant keyword associations      | Negative or off-brand keyword trends           |

## Cross-LLM Insights

Different AI models may present your brand differently — this is normal, as each LLM has unique training data and response behavior.
